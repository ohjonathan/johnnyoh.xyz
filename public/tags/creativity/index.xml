      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the bottleneck isn&amp;rsquo;t your skillsets, but your intention. It&amp;rsquo;s not about what you can or can&amp;rsquo;t do; it&amp;rsquo;s whether you know what you actually want to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot lately. The conversation around AI is dominated by productivity and coding, and for good reason. But there&amp;rsquo;s a quieter shift happening in creative expression that I think deserves more attention.
